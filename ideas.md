# Game ideas

The game is basicly a 2D platform game, where the player has a posibility to
rotate the world/gravity to be able to continue the game in any direction. 

##Weapons:
* Spaceblaster - a traditional ranged weapon
* Anti gravity grenades, make foes float upwards.
* Gravity grenades, make foes glued to the ground.

##Foes:
* Space Mites - small, hurts a little, comes in flocks
* Star Hogs - medium, hurts more, single foe. poops sticky stuff that makes you move 1/5 of normal speed for a while
* Moon morons, large, hurts alot, stupid - easy to trick not to follow you.

##Upgrades:
* Reinforsments - health, stamina, weapon damage, damage resistans
* Mechsuit - gives size and strength, makes it possible to toss foes.
